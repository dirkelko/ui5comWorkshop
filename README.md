# Metadata-driven Value Help for JSON Models
## Description

This repository contains the material for the UI5Con Workshop **Metadata-driven Value Help for JSON Models**.

## Overview

In this session, you will learn about developing a value help scenario with the new **sap.ui.mdc** library for a simple JSON model. We start with an input field and a form which displays the properties of an SAP building if the ID of the building has been entered into the input field.
